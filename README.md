<h2 id="start"> Getting Started  üéâ </h2>

This repo is a monorepo containing decentralized interfaces into the Webb protocol! It makes use of [nx.dev](https://nx.dev/) for fast and extensible build system. The repo consists of 3 notable areas:

- [bridge-dapp:](https://github.com/webb-tools/webb-dapp/tree/develop/apps/bridge-dapp) an interface for interacting and bridging assets cross-chain using Webb's Asset Protocol
- [stats-dapp:](https://github.com/webb-tools/webb-dapp/tree/develop/apps/stats-dapp) an interface for displaying statistics data of Webb's Tangle Network  
- [webb-ui-components:](https://github.com/webb-tools/webb-dapp/tree/develop/libs/webb-ui-components) a collection of reusable components for building interfaces quickly


For additional information, please refer to the [Webb Official Documentation](https://docs.webb.tools/v1/getting-started/overview/) üìù. Have feedback on how to improve the webb-dapp interface? Or have a specific question to ask? Checkout the [Webb Dapp Feedback Discussion](https://github.com/webb-tools/feedback/discussions/categories/webb-dapp-feedback) üí¨.

## Prerequisites

This repository makes use of yarn, nodejs, and requires version node v16. To install node.js binaries, installers, and source tarballs, please visit https://nodejs.org/en/download/. Once node.js is installed you may proceed to install [`yarn`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install):

```bash
npm install --global yarn
```

Great! Now your **Node** environment is ready! üöÄüöÄ

## Run Hubble bridge locally üíª

Once the development environment is set up, you may proceed to install the required dependencies and run the dapp locally.

1. Clone this repo

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:webb-tools/webb-dapp.git && cd webb-dapp
   ```

2. Install dependencies by `yarn`

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start the bridge-dapp:

   ```bash
   yarn start:bridge
   ```

Visit http://localhost:3000/ to see the Webb Bridge Dapp UI! üï∏Ô∏è üöÄ

### Run local Webb relayer and local network alongside Hubble bridge

To make local development and testing easier we can run a local EVM network and a local Webb relayer. In doing so, we will have access to a large supply of test tokens, access to both relayer and network logs to observe any unexpected issues during development. To accomplish this follow the below instructions.

#### Setting up local testnet

Before setting up a local testnet, we first need to clear our local storage in the browser for dApp to work correctly with our local evm testnet. 

**1. Clear local storage in the browser**

Next, we will open a separate terminal window and execute the following instructions. For more in-depth protocol-solidity setup please refer to the [`README.md`](https://github.com/webb-tools/protocol-solidity#-getting-started---)


**2. Clone the [protocol-solidity](https://github.com/webb-tools/protocol-solidity) repo**

```
git clone https://github.com/webb-tools/protocol-solidity/
cd protocol-solidity
```

**3. Install dependencies** 

```
yarn install
```

**4. Fetch submodules** 

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

**5. Populate fixtures from the submodules:**

‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE:** Prerequisites for fetching fixtures is to have [dvc](https://dvc.org/) installed locally. You can view installation instructions [here](https://dvc.org/doc/install). For macos it is recommended to install using `pip install dvc`. 

```
yarn fetch:fixtures
```

**6. Compile contracts and build typescript interfaces**

```
yarn build
```

**7. Start local test network** 

```
npx ts-node ./scripts/evm/deployments/LocalEvmVBridge.ts
```

Great! Now you have a running local EVM test network. 

#### Setting up local relayer 

To make use of a local relayer we will open a separate terminal window and execute the following instructions. For more in-depth relayer setup please refer to the relayer [`README.md`](https://github.com/webb-tools/relayer#-getting-started---)

**1. Clone the [relayer](https://github.com/webb-tools/relayer) repo**

```
git clone https://github.com/webb-tools/relayer
cd relayer
```

**2. Compile the relayer** 

```
cargo build --release --features cli
```

**3. Run a local relayer**

```
./target/release/webb-relayer -c config/development/evm-localnet/ -vv
```

Great! Now you have a running local relayer. 

We now have our local environment running, next we will want to setup our MetaMask wallet to add test tokens and **reset the account** on Metamask to reset the account‚Äôs nonce and tx history. Please refer to the support article [here](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015488891-How-to-reset-an-account) for instructions on how to reset a MetaMask account.  

Lastly, we will want to one of the following accounts to obtain test tokens.

```
// Any of these keys has 1000 ETH on each testnet
0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002
0xc0d375903fd6f6ad3edafc2c5428900c0757ce1da10e5dd864fe387b32b91d7e
```

If you are unfamiliar with how to import an account with MetaMask, please refer to the support article [here](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489331-How-to-import-an-account#:~:text=Click%20the%20circle%20icon%20at,key%20and%20click%20%E2%80%9CImport%E2%80%9D).  

You have now successfully setup:
- local evm test network 
- local Webb relayer 
- local Hubble bridge
- configured your MetaMask wallet for testing / development 

Happy hacking! üöÄüíª
