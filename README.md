<h2 id="start"> Getting Started  üéâ </h2>

This repo is a monorepo containing decentralized interfaces into the Webb protocol! It makes use of [nx.dev](https://nx.dev/) for fast and extensible build system. The repo consists of 3 notable areas:

- [bridge-dapp:](https://github.com/webb-tools/webb-dapp/tree/develop/apps/bridge-dapp) an interface for interacting and bridging assets cross-chain using Webb's Asset Protocol.
- [stats-dapp:](https://github.com/webb-tools/webb-dapp/tree/develop/apps/stats-dapp) an interface for displaying statistics data of Webb's Tangle Network.
- [webbsite:](https://github.com/webb-tools/webb-dapp/tree/develop/apps/webbsite) an interface for the Webb ecosystem and development.
- [webb-ui-components:](https://github.com/webb-tools/webb-dapp/tree/develop/libs/webb-ui-components) a collection of reusable components for building interfaces quickly.

For additional information, please refer to the [Webb Official Documentation](https://docs.webb.tools/) üìù. Have feedback on how to improve the webb-dapp interface? Or have a specific question to ask? Checkout the [Webb Dapp Feedback Discussion](https://github.com/webb-tools/feedback/discussions/categories/webb-dapp-feedback) üí¨.

## Prerequisites

This repository makes use of yarn, nodejs, and requires version node v16. To install node.js binaries, installers, and source tarballs, please visit https://nodejs.org/en/download/. Once node.js is installed you may proceed to install [`yarn`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install):

```bash
npm install --global yarn
```

Great! Now your **Node** environment is ready! üöÄüöÄ

## Run Hubble bridge locally üíª

Once the development environment is set up, you may proceed to install the required dependencies and run the dapp locally.

1. Clone this repo

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:webb-tools/webb-dapp.git && cd webb-dapp
   ```

2. Install dependencies by `yarn`

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start the bridge-dapp:

   ```bash
   yarn start:bridge
   ```

Visit `http://localhost:3000/` to see the Webb Bridge Dapp UI! üï∏Ô∏è üöÄ If you would like to utilize the Hubble bridge
with a local EVM network and local relayer refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/webb-tools/webb-dapp/tree/develop/apps/bridge-dapp#webb-hubble-bridge).

### Setting Up a Local EVM Network with Hubble Bridge

If you want to create a local EVM network with a local relayer and Hubble bridge, we have step-by-step instructions you can follow [here](https://github.com/webb-tools/webb-dapp/tree/develop/apps/bridge-dapp#webb-hubble-bridge). Before setting up a local EVM network be sure to clear your `localStorage`. 

If you're comfortable running scripts and using a macOS environment, you can use the following scripts in the `/tools/scripts/` directory to quickly set up a local testing environment:

- `contracts.sh`: This script compiles Webb smart contracts from [protocol-solidity](https://github.com/webb-tools/protocol-solidity), sets up an EVM localnet (e.g. Hermes, Athena, and Demeter), and populates required fixtures. You can use this script on its own.
- `relayer.sh`: This script sets up the required `.env` variables for running a [Webb relayer](https://github.com/webb-tools/relayer) for the EVM localnets, fetches the `webb-relayer` binary, and executes it. You must have an EVM localnet running to use this script.
- `bridge.sh`: This script sets up and starts the Hubble bridge at `localhost:3000`. You can use this script on its own.
- `local-bridge-network.sh`: This script runs all the above scripts for an entire local network setup. It compiles the Webb smart contracts, sets up the EVM localnet, adds the required `.env` variables, fetches the `webb-relayer` binary, executes it, and starts the local Hubble bridge at `localhost:3000`. It opens three Terminal windows and can only be run in a macOS environment.

We now have our local environment running, next we will want to setup our MetaMask wallet to add test tokens and **reset the account** on Metamask to reset the account‚Äôs nonce and tx history. Please refer to the support article [here](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015488891-How-to-reset-an-account) for instructions on how to reset a MetaMask account.  

Lastly, we will want to one of the following accounts to obtain test tokens.

```
// Any of these keys has 1000 ETH on each testnet
0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002
0xc0d375903fd6f6ad3edafc2c5428900c0757ce1da10e5dd864fe387b32b91d7e
```

If you are unfamiliar with how to import an account with MetaMask, please refer to the support article [here](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489331-How-to-import-an-account#:~:text=Click%20the%20circle%20icon%20at,key%20and%20click%20%E2%80%9CImport%E2%80%9D).  

## Run stats-dapp locally üíª

Once the development environment is set up, you may proceed to install the required dependencies and run the dapp locally.

1. Clone this repo

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:webb-tools/webb-dapp.git && cd webb-dapp
   ```

2. Install dependencies by `yarn`

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start the stats-dapp:
